# homomorphic-encryption-cloud-computation
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) using the TenSEAL library in a simulated client-cloud environment. It securely performs computations on encrypted data without revealing the original values, showcasing how privacy-preserving analytics can be achieved in untrusted systems.

Features
Implements BFV encryption scheme with TenSEAL.

Simulates client-side encryption and cloud-side computation.

Demonstrates encrypted sum and decrypted average calculation.

Ensures data privacy during computation.

Modular, readable, and well-documented code.

Technologies Used
Python 3.11+

TenSEAL

Microsoft SEAL (via TenSEAL bindings)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks
